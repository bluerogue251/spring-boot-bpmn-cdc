* Set up user authentication
  - Binary authenticated/not-authenticated is fine for now, no need for finer grained access control

* Configure flyway to NOT auto run at app startup time (performance considerations)
  - Instead, there should be a special maven command to migrate the dev db, or even do a template / dev / test db setup...

* Set up an Angular App Frontend

* Set up an Activiti process for Batches/SampleDataSources/Reports
  - Unfulfilled reports will prompt users to create batches
  - Batch creation will prompt users to mark batches as "started"
  - Marking a batch as "started" will prompt users to upload a CSV with data from that batch -- thereby marking the batch as "under BioQC"
  - Uploading a CSV with data will create SampleDataSources that then go through:
    a) QC_PENDING
    b) QC_DECLINED
    c) QC_APPROVED
    process
  - Marking a SampleDataSource as QC_DECLINED or QC_APPROVED or QC_PENDING will update the status of the report it can be attached to and the batch it belongs to

* Set up CDC (Bottled Water or Debezium) and a UI to explore changes to data
  - Ideally we will be able to see in this UI _who_ the logged in user at the time of each change was
