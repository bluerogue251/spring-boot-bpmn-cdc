## Still to do:

* Set up an Activiti process for Batches/SampleDataSources/Reports
  - Unfulfilled reports will prompt users to create batches/put samples on batches...
  - Batch creation will prompt users to mark batches as "started"
  - Marking a batch as "started" will prompt users to upload a CSV with data from that batch -- thereby marking the batch as "under BioQC"
  - Uploading a CSV with data will create SampleDataSources that then go through:
    a) QC_PENDING
    b) QC_DECLINED
    c) QC_APPROVED
    process
  - Marking a SampleDataSource as QC_DECLINED or QC_APPROVED or QC_PENDING will update the status of the report it can be attached to and the batch it belongs to

* Set up CDC (Bottled Water or Debezium)

* Set up a UI to do a very generalized search on any batch, sampleDataSource, or report (using Elasticsearch) using CDC data to build search indices

* Set up a UI to show historical changes to data as captured by CDC
  - Ideally we will be able to see in this UI _who_ the logged in user at the time of each change was

* Set up a production build with Jenkins
  - Should push to Elastic Beanstalk
  - Should be able to run tests
  - Should be able to migrate the production db after a manual confirmation showing what the changes will be (i.e. the `flyway info` output)

* Put flyway and its resources into a separate maven module
  - Exclude these resources (such as migration SQL files) from the resulting compiled app code to avoid excessive copying

* Use a CSS framework to improve the appearance of the app

* Configure Logged in Session storage as web browser cookies, to prevent signout during app server restarts.



## Already Done

* Set up an MVP Wicket Frontend

* Configure flyway and the app to use two separate db users (flyway the superuser, the app a read/write user)

* Set up user authentication
  - Binary authenticated/not-authenticated is fine for now, no need for finer grained access control
  - I ended up doing this with Bcrypt password encoder

* Configure flyway to NOT auto run at app startup time (performance considerations)
  - Instead, there should be a special maven command to migrate the dev db, or even do a template / dev / test db setup...
